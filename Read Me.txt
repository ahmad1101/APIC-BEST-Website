The stylesheets have been made according to their
html counterparts. Each html page has two stylesheets.
One stylesheet contains the basic styles that apply to
html page. While the other stylesheet contains the 
styles that add responsiveness to the page. This is done
to make the stylesheets as clutterfree as possible.

---------IMPORTANT---------
While replacing images make sure that they have the same name as 
mentioned in the html file or rename them in the html file.
