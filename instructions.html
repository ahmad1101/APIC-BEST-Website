  <h2>Presentation Guidelines</h2>
  <p>These guidelines have been prepared in order to bring formatting homogeneity in the presentations. All
  speakers are kindly requested to follow these general guidelines for the preparation of their PowerPoint
presentations.</p>

<ol class="list">
  <li>The total time allotted to each speaker is 15 minutes. You should plan to speak for 12 minutes and leave 3 minutes for questions.</li>
  <li>There is <strong>NO EXCUSE</strong> for using more than your allotted time.
  Rehearse your presentation several times; projecting slides and doing anything else you would
other expect to do at the meeting. It is a discourtesy to your audience, the Session Chair and other speakers to exceed your
allotted time. The Session Chairs are instructed to adhere to the printed schedule for the session.
With parallel sessions this is critical to the overall success of the conference.</li>
  <li>It is generally an accepted principle that too much information either in the form of text
  or graphics tends to make the presentation slides difficult to focus on for the audience.</li>
  <li>Font size of bullets must not be less than 28 points and the font size of slide headers must not be less than 32 points.</li>
  <li>Preferably no more than 5 bullets in each slide and not more than 6 words on each bullet.</li>
  <li>It is recommended not to include more than 15 - 20 slides for 25 minutes presentation. Please note that the time over-run
  will not be permitted.</li>
  <li>The Conference technical staff is responsible for projecting the presentation file for respective speakers according to the finalized program.</li>
  <li>All speakers would personally and directly conduct and monitor their presentations from the rostrum.</li>
